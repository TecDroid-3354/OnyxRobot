/**
 * The following class was created with the objective of serving as a template for an autonomous routine.
 * This class is similar to the [TeleOpMode], however, the [GamepadEx] and its command are inexistent here.
 * Declared below the [Robot] is the [autonomousCommand] which is a [SequentialCommandGroup] and is the only command
 * that will be executed along the whole routine. You can nest inside the [autonomousCommand] several [Robot.followPathCMD],
 * [SequentialCommandGroup], [ParallelDeadlineGroup], [InstantCommand], etc.
 * You'll need to create an instance of a Paths class like [ExamplePaths] and initialize it with an [Alliance]. Once initialized
 * the [AutonomousBuilder] can be initialized with both [Alliance.RED] or [Alliance.BLUE] and paths will be mirrored flawlessly.
 * Complete each [TODO] inside [AutonomousBuilder] and the class will be ready to become the inheritor of an [com.qualcomm.robotcore.eventloop.opmode.Autonomous].
